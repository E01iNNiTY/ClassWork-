    <h1>Week 13 Vocabulary</h1>

    <h2>Uniform Resource Locator (URL)</h2>
    <p>
      A URL is the address used to access resources on the Internet. It specifies the protocol (e.g., <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>), the domain name, and often a path to a specific file or resource.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Firewall</h2>
    <p>
      A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls serve as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP)</h2>
    <p>
      A suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the Internet. TCP handles reliable data transmission, while IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Network Protocols</h2>
    <p>
      Sets of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices can communicate with each other effectively.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Computer Network</h2>
    <p>
      A collection of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other to share resources and information.
    </p>
  
    <h2>IPv4</h2>
    <p>
      The fourth version of the Internet Protocol, which uses 32-bit addresses to uniquely identify devices on a network. It is one of the core protocols that underpin the Internet.
    </p>
  
    <h2>IPv6</h2>
    <p>
      The successor to IPv4, designed to address the shortage of available IPv4 addresses. IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, allowing for a significantly larger number of unique identifiers.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Domain Name Services (DNS)</h2>
    <p>
      A hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like <code>www.example.com</code>) into IP addresses, enabling browsers to load Internet resources.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Hyper-text Transfer Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)</h2>
    <p>
      Protocols used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, over the Internet. HTTP is unsecured, while HTTPS provides encryption for secure communication.
    </p>
  
    <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
    <p>
      A standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a computer network.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Software Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Agreed-upon guidelines and specifications that software products or processes should adhere to, ensuring consistency, compatibility, and quality across different systems.
    </p>
  
    <h2>OSI Model</h2>
    <p>
      The Open Systems Interconnection Model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.
