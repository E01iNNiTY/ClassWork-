        <h1>Week 12 Vocabulary</h1>
        
        <h2>Web Framework</h2>
        <p>
          A web framework is a software platform designed to support the development of web applications. It provides standardized tools and libraries that simplify tasks like routing, database interaction, and templating.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Functional Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Functional testing verifies that each function of an application operates in conformance with the required specifications. This type of testing focuses on what the system does and ensures that user inputs produce the expected outputs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Non-functional Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Non-functional testing examines aspects of a system that are not related to specific behaviors or functions. This includes testing for performance, usability, reliability, and security, ensuring that the system meets overall quality standards.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Content Management System (CMS)</h2>
        <p>
          A CMS is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and modify website content without needing advanced technical knowledge. Popular CMS examples include <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Drupal</strong>, and <strong>Joomla</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure they function correctly. This testing is usually automated using frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Integration testing focuses on verifying that different components or systems work together as intended. It checks the interfaces and data flow between modules to ensure proper communication and functionality.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Regression Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Regression testing is performed to ensure that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. It involves re-running previous tests after updates to verify that the system still performs as expected.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Load Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Load testing measures how a system performs under a specific, expected load. It simulates multiple users or processes accessing the system simultaneously to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Smoke Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Smoke testing is a preliminary testing phase that checks whether the most crucial functions of an application work correctly. It helps determine whether a build is stable enough for further, more detailed testing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Mocks, Mocking</h2>
        <p>
          Mocks are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects during testing. Mocking allows developers to isolate the code under test by replacing dependencies with controlled stand-ins, verifying interactions and outputs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Acceptance Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Acceptance testing is performed by end-users or clients to determine if a system meets the required specifications and is ready for production. This final phase of testing ensures that the software meets business needs and user expectations.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
        <p>
          TDD is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. Developers write a failing test, then write the minimum code required to pass that test, and finally refactor the code. This cycle ensures that each feature is thoroughly tested.
