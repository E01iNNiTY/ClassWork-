<main>
  <dl>
    <dt>Decomposition</dt>
    <dd>Breaking a large, complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.</dd>

    <dt>Inheritance (in OOP)</dt>
    <dd>A mechanism where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchy.</dd>

    <dt>Algorithmic Thinking</dt>
    <dd>The process of defining a step-by-step solution or algorithm to solve a problem, often breaking it down into clear, logical procedures.</dd>

    <dt>Refactoring</dt>
    <dd>Improving the internal structure of existing code without altering its external behavior, enhancing readability, maintainability, and performance.</dd>

    <dt>Variables</dt>
    <dd>Named storage locations in a program that hold values. These values can change during the execution of the program.</dd>

    <dt>Loops</dt>
    <dd>Control structures that repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.</dd>

    <dt>Abstraction</dt>
    <dd>Hiding complex implementation details to expose only the essential features, making systems easier to understand and use.</dd>

    <dt>Relational Operators</dt>
    <dd>Operators that compare two values (like &lt;, &gt;, ==, !=) and return a boolean result (true or false).</dd>

    <dt>Mathematic Operators</dt>
    <dd>Operators used to perform arithmetic calculations, such as + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).</dd>

    <dt>Pattern Recognition</dt>
    <dd>Identifying repeating structures or sequences within data or problems, helping in making predictions and simplifying solutions.</dd>

    <dt>Logical Operators</dt>
    <dd>Operators that combine or invert boolean values, such as AND, OR, and NOT, to form more complex logical expressions.</dd>

    <dt>Conditional Branching Operators</dt>
    <dd>Instructions that direct the program to execute certain parts of code only if specific conditions are met (e.g., if, else, switch statements).</dd>
